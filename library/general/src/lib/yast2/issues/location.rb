module Yast2
  module Issues
    # Represent the location of an error
    #
    # It can be a file, a section of an AutoYaST profile, etc. This class is rather open and
    # its API can change once we know more about error reporting.
    #
    # The concept of "location" is introduce to tell the user where to look for a problem and as
    # a mechanism to group the issues.
    #
    # A location is composed by three parts:
    #
    # * type: whether the location is a file, an AutoYaST profile section, etc.
    # * path: location path (file path, AutoYaST profile path, etc.)
    # * id: it can be the file line, a key, an AutoYaST element name, etc. This element is optional.
    class Location
      # @return [String] Location type ("file", "autoyast", etc.)
      attr_reader :type
      # @return [String] Location path (a file path, an AutoYaST section path, and so on)
      attr_reader :path
      # @return [String,nil] Location ID within the path
      attr_reader :id

      # Parse a string and creates a location
      #
      # The string contains the type, the path and the id, separated by colons.
      #
      # @example AutoYaST section reference
      #   location = Location.parse("autoyast:partitioning,1,partition,0:filesystem_type")
      #   location.type #=> "ay"
      #   location.path #=> "partitioning,1,partition,0"
      #   location.id   #=> "filesystem_type"
      #
      # @example File reference
      #   location = Location.parse("file:/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0:BOOTPROTO")
      #   location.type #=> "file"
      #   location.path #=> "/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0"
      #   location.id   #=> "BOOTPROTO"
      #
      # @param str [String] Path specification
      # @return [Location]
      def self.parse(str)
        type, path, id = str.split(":")
        new(type, path, id)
      end

      # @param type [String] Location type
      # @param path [String] Location path
      # @param id   [String,nil] Location ID, if needed
      def initialize(type, path, id = nil)
        @type = type
        @path = path
        @id = id
      end
    end
  end
